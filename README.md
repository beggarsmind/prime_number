 A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. In other words, a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. 

Importance of Prime Numbers :- 

*Foundation of Number Theory: Prime numbers are considered the "building blocks" of the integers because any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes (this is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).

*Applications in Cryptography: Prime numbers play a crucial role in modern cryptography, especially in algorithms like RSA, which relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large primes.

*Mathematical Research: Primes are a subject of extensive research in mathematics, leading to many interesting theorems and conjectures, such as the Goldbach Conjecture and the Twin Prime Conjecture.

Prime Number Theorems :-


Prime Number Theorem: This theorem describes the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers. It states that the number of primes less than a given number

 * Wilson's Theorem: A prime number
